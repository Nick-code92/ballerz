# USER STORY:
As an avid NBA fan I want to be able to view specific NBA players and there individual stats.

# ABOUT:
This application was designed for NBA fans to access certain stats for a specific player. Authentication was implemented so that users can sign up and login in to see NBA player's stats. Using MongoDb we were able to call the data to cards. The cards render a profile on the players page. From there you will be able to add any player you would like to your "fantasy team" page and view all the stats side by side of another player.
On there you can see the current players you have selected, or you can delete or add new players as well! The Plottly bar graph displays the individual data in bars and also has a toolbar that allows the user to hover over specific things in the graph to display that data being hovered over.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED:
